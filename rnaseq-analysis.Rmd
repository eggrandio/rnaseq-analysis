Data preprocessing (done remotely in usegalaxy.org)

1- Trim low quality bases (Trimmomatic)

2- Align paired-end reads (HISAT2)

3- Remove reads that do not map, map to several regions or are unpaired (Filter BAM)

4- Count reads per annotated gene (FeatureCounts): outputs "Feature_count.txt" and "feature_length.tabular" files

5- Compare expression between samples (DESeq2):
